# Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to clean and validate hospital records
and load them into a data warehouse.

Ramses is provided simulated datasets consisting of records of
`r formatC(length(unique(inpatient_episodes$encounter_id)), big.mark = ",")`
hospitalisations for
`r formatC(length(unique(inpatient_episodes$patient_id)), big.mark = ",")`
patients, complete with prescriptions, diagnoses and care episodes
records.

# Setup

First, packages must be loaded.

```{r setup, warning=F, message=F}
library(Ramses)
library(dplyr)    # to facilitate data manipulations
```

Second, a relational database server is needed.

For the purposes of this vignette, one may use on a small [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)
database on the local hard drive. This
database will behave in a similar way as a dedicated relational database
server. This method should only be used for training with simulated data
as it is not a secure method of handling actual patient data.

```{r DuckDB_init}
ramses_db <- connect_local_database("ramses-db.duckdb")
```

Alternatively, one may use a dedicated PostgreSQL server (other SQL
databases are not currently supported). In this case, we use the DBI and
RPostgres packages to initiate the connection:

```{r Postgres_init, eval=FALSE}
ramses_db <- DBI::dbConnect(
  RPostgres::Postgres(), 
  host = 'example_server_name' ,
  dbname = 'example_database_name',
  user = 'username', 
  password = 'password', 
  port = 5432, 
  # Do not forget to specify a time zone to correctly collect datetime records
  timezone = "Europe/London")

# Specify the name of the schema Ramses should use on the database 
# (if not, Ramses will use 'public' by default)
DBI::dbExecute(ramses_db, "SET search_path = ramses_schema, public;")
```

Whatever method is used, the database connection information is stored
in an object (here `ramses_db`) which must be provided to most functions
in the Ramses package.

We can now begin preparing records and loading them into the database.
This involves three steps:

1.  *Transform*: adding metadata and transforming records to conform
    with Ramses data validation constraints
2.  *Validate*: using dedicated functions (eg:
    `validate_inpatient_episodes()`) to verify that all data conform to
    Ramses data validation constraints
3.  *Load*: loading records into a SQL database.

# Medication records

## Drug prescriptions

We begin with prescription records (you may choose to start with
other records).

```{r print_prescriptions}
str(drug_prescriptions)
```

Prescriptions records must conform to data validation requirements
listed in the documentation for `validate_prescriptions()`

We first map drug concepts using the `as.ab()` function provided by
the [AMR package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AMR). This function takes a character variable as input and
returns a three-letter code identifying antifungals and antibacterials.
These give access to the AMR package's wide range
of analytical methods. Although the AMR package does not currently
provide equivalent mapping for antiparasitic and antiviral drugs, these
can be mapped to any substance-level terminology of your choice. RxNorm
[Ingredients](https://mor.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/search?searchBy=RXCUI&searchTerm=69722)
and SNOMED CT UK Edition [Virtual Therapeutic
Moieties](https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&conceptId1=116100000&edition=uk-edition&server=https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/sct-browser-api/snomed&langRefset=999001261000000100,999000691000001104)
are both good options.

```{r map_drug_failing}
# attempting to map drug name using AMR package
drug_prescriptions$drug_code <- AMR::as.ab(drug_prescriptions$tr_DESC)
```

Some manual editing may be required when drugs are not successfully
mapped, as shown in the example below.

```{r map_drug}
# editing drug names
drug_prescriptions$drug_code <- gsub("Vancomycin protocol", 
                                   "Vancomycin",
                                   drug_prescriptions$tr_DESC)
# mapping drug name using AMR package
drug_prescriptions$drug_code <- AMR::as.ab(drug_prescriptions$drug_code)
drug_prescriptions$drug_name <- AMR::ab_name(drug_prescriptions$drug_code)
```

We also map the route of administration to the World Health Organisation
[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System
(ATC)](https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/) codes:

```{r map_atc_route}
# recoding route of administration
drug_prescriptions <- mutate(drug_prescriptions, 
  ATC_route = 
    case_when(
      route %in% c(NULL) ~ "Implant", 
      route %in% c("NEB", "INHAL") ~ "Inhal", 
      route %in% c("TOP", "EYE", "EYEL", "EYER", "EYEB", 
                   "EAR", "EARL", "EARR", "EARB") ~ "Instill", 
      route %in% c("NASAL", "NOST", "NOSTL", "NOSTR", "NOSTB") ~ "N", 
      route %in% c("ORAL", "NAS", "PEG") ~ "O", 
      route %in% c("IV", "IVB", "IVI", "IMI", "IT", "IVT") ~ "P", 
      route %in% c("PR") ~ "R", 
      route %in% c("BUCC", "SB", "OROM", "SUBL") ~ "SL", 
      route %in% c("SC", "ID") ~ "TD", 
      route %in% c("PV") ~ "V", 
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    ))

```

Using the AMR package, it is possible to infer important properties of
antibacterial/antifungal drugs:

-   ATC classes and groups, which can be useful for instance in order
    to identify antifungals (group 'Antimycotics for systemic use')
-   Defined Daily Doses (DDDs), which are commonly used to measure drug
    consumption.

```{r get_atc_code}
# extracting the ATC code (eg J01CR02) group (eg Beta-lactam antibacterials, penicillins)
drug_prescriptions$ATC_code <- AMR::ab_atc(drug_prescriptions$drug_code, only_first = TRUE)
drug_prescriptions$ATC_group <- AMR::ab_atc_group1(drug_prescriptions$drug_code)
# removing antifungal drugs, if applicable
drug_prescriptions <- filter(drug_prescriptions, 
                             ATC_group != "Antimycotics for systemic use")
```

Working out the prescription DDDs can be complex in the case of compound
medications. The ATC provides reference DDDs with respect to the main
substance in a given medication. For example:

* Co-amoxiclav is composed of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (ATC code: [J01CR02](https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=J01CR02)). Its reference DDD 
can be obtained directly from

```{r eval=FALSE}
paste0(AMR::ab_ddd("co-amoxiclav", "oral"), 
       AMR::ab_ddd("co-amoxiclav", "oral", unit = T))
```

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type:none;">that is, 1.5g. The corresponding [web page](https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=J01CR02) notes this 
dose refers to the amoxicillin content only. A prescription of 
Augmentin 625mg TDS (three times a day) tablets containing 500mg of amoxicillin, the 
total dose prescribed per day is 1.5g or of amoxicillin per day, or 1.0 DDD. </li>
<li>More complex compounds are documented [here](https://www.whocc.no/ddd/list_of_ddds_combined_products/). For instance, co-trimoxazole (ATC code: J01EE01) is composed of 5 parts of sulfamethoxazole to 1 part of
trimethoprim. The ATC reference DDD for sulfamethoxazole is 2g while the
DDD of trimethoprim is 400mg: with this ratio of 5 to 1, DDDs calculated
on the basis of the dosage of sulfamethoxazole will be valid for
co-trimoxazole prepared with 5 parts to 1 part. These just some
examples.</li>
</ul>

In order to obtain the correct DDDs for compound medications, it is
recommended to map data to a suitable dictionary of medicines such as
the [RxNorm](https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/) or the
[SNOMED CT UK Drug Extension](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/dictionary-medicines-and-devices-dmd) and extract the corresponding ATC codes and DDDs.

In this example, however, we use a look-up table for the strength of
compound medications.

```{r prepare_ddd}
# prepare DDD extraction
compound_strength_lookup <- data.frame(list(
  drug_code = c("AMC", "AMC", "TZP", "SMX"),
  route = c("oral", "oral", "oral", "oral"),
  dose = c(625, 1.2, 4.5, 480),
  units = c("mg", "g", "g", "mg"),
  strength = c(500, 1, 4, 400),
  basis_of_strength = c("AMX", "AMX", "PIP", "SMX")
), stringsAsFactors = F)

drug_prescriptions <- merge(drug_prescriptions, 
                            compound_strength_lookup, 
                            all.x = T)

drug_prescriptions <- drug_prescriptions %>% 
  mutate(strength = if_else(is.na(strength), dose, strength),  
         basis_of_strength = if_else(is.na(basis_of_strength),
                                     as.character(drug_code),
                                     basis_of_strength))
```

Ramses provides another look-up table `Ramses::reference_drug_frequency` to help convert the `frequency` character variable into a numeric variable indicating the daily frequency of administration.

```{r daily_freq}
drug_prescriptions <- merge(drug_prescriptions, 
                            reference_drug_frequency, by = "frequency", all.x = T)
```

We can now compute the prescription DDD based on the ATC reference DDDs
and the daily frequency of administration:

```{r compute_ddd}
drug_prescriptions <- drug_prescriptions %>% 
  mutate(daily_dose = strength * daily_frequency) %>% 
  mutate(DDD = compute_DDDs(
    ATC_code = AMR::ab_atc(basis_of_strength, only_first = TRUE),
    ATC_administration = ATC_route,
    dose = daily_dose,
    unit = units)) %>% 
  mutate(duration_days = if_else(
    daily_frequency == -1,
    "one-off", 
    if_else(
      round(difftime(prescription_end, 
                     prescription_start, 
                     units = "days")) == 1,
      "1 day", 
      paste(round(difftime(prescription_end, 
                           prescription_start, 
                           units = "days")),
            "days")
      )
  ))
```

```{r}
drug_prescriptions <- drug_prescriptions %>% 
  transmute(patient_id,
            prescription_id,
            # prescription summary for displaying in interfaces
            prescription_text = paste0(
              drug_name, " ", 
              route, " ", 
              dose, units, " ", 
              duration_days
            ),
            drug_code,
            drug_name = drug_name,
            drug_display_name = drug_name,
            # in this example dataset, only antibacterial drugs are included
            antiinfective_type = "antibacterial", 
            ATC_code,
            ATC_group,
            ATC_route,
            authoring_date,
            prescription_start,
            prescription_end,
            prescription_status = "completed",
            prescription_context = "inpatient",
            dose,
            unit = units,
            route,
            frequency,
            daily_frequency,
            DDD)
```

## Drug administrations

An identical process is followed for drug administration, with the
difference that DDDs refer to the dose of a single administration, and
thus do not involve a frequency variable.

```{r prepare_drug_admin}
drug_administrations$drug_code <- gsub("Vancomycin protocol", 
                                     "Vancomycin", 
                                     drug_administrations$tr_DESC)
drug_administrations$drug_code <- AMR::as.ab(drug_administrations$drug_code)
drug_administrations$drug_name <- AMR::ab_name(drug_administrations$drug_code)
drug_administrations$drug_group <- AMR::ab_group(drug_administrations$drug_code)
# recoding route of administration
drug_administrations <- mutate(drug_administrations, 
  ATC_route = 
    case_when(
      route %in% c(NULL) ~ "Implant", 
      route %in% c("NEB", "INHAL") ~ "Inhal", 
      route %in% c("TOP", "EYE", "EYEL", "EYER", "EYEB", 
                   "EAR", "EARL", "EARR", "EARB") ~ "Instill", 
      route %in% c("NASAL", "NOST", "NOSTL", "NOSTR", "NOSTB") ~ "N", 
      route %in% c("ORAL", "NAS", "PEG") ~ "O", 
      route %in% c("IV", "IVB", "IVI", "IMI", "IT", "IVT") ~ "P", 
      route %in% c("PR") ~ "R", 
      route %in% c("BUCC", "SB", "OROM", "SUBL") ~ "SL", 
      route %in% c("SC", "ID") ~ "TD", 
      route %in% c("PV") ~ "V", 
      TRUE ~ "NA_character_"
    ))
drug_administrations$ATC_code <- AMR::ab_atc(drug_administrations$drug_code, only_first = TRUE)
drug_administrations <- filter(drug_administrations, 
                               drug_group != "Antifungals/antimycotics")

drug_administrations <- merge(drug_administrations, compound_strength_lookup, all.x = T)
drug_administrations <- drug_administrations %>% 
  mutate(strength = if_else(is.na(strength), dose, strength),
         basis_of_strength = if_else(is.na(basis_of_strength),
                                     as.character(drug_code),
                                     basis_of_strength))

drug_administrations <- drug_administrations %>% 
  mutate(DDD = compute_DDDs(
    ATC_code = AMR::ab_atc(basis_of_strength, only_first = TRUE),
    ATC_administration = ATC_route,
    dose = dose,
    unit = units 
  )) 

# Create an identifier
# Note: An alternative is encryption using openssl::sha256()
      
drug_administrations <- drug_administrations %>%
  group_by(patient_id, drug_code, route,
           dose, units, administration_date) %>% 
  mutate(administration_id = dplyr::cur_group_id()) %>% 
  ungroup()

drug_administrations <- drug_administrations %>% 
    transmute(
      patient_id,
      administration_id = as.character(administration_id),
      prescription_id,
      administration_text = paste0(
          drug_name, " ", route, " ", dose, units),
      drug_code,
      drug_name,
      drug_display_name = drug_name,
      drug_group,
      # in this example dataset, only antibacterial drugs are included
      antiinfective_type = "antibacterial", 
      ATC_code,
      ATC_route,
      dose,
      unit = units,
      route,
      administration_date,
      administration_status = "completed",
      DDD
    )
```

This data frame can now be validated, before being loaded into the
database.

```{r load_rx}
validate_administrations(drug_administrations)

load_medications(conn = ramses_db, 
                 prescriptions = drug_prescriptions, 
                 administrations = drug_administrations, 
                 overwrite = TRUE,
                 silent = FALSE)
```

# Inpatient care records

## Admissions

We now turn to records of patient demographics, admissions, discharges
and transfers. Ramses is designed around the notion of *hospital encounters*
identified by variable `encounter_id`, which correspond to the window from
the time a patient is admitted to the time a patient is discharged.

In addition, Ramses use subdivisions of *hospital encounters* called
*episodes of care*, which designate a continuous period of inpatient
care under the responsibility of a department, specialty, or clinical
team. This corresponds to the 'finished consultant episode' in the UK
NHS Admitted Patient Care data model [@Herbert2017]. All *hospital
encounters* consist of at least one *episode of care*. Episodes of care are
used to calculate bed-days as well as rates of infection, prescribing
and other stewardship metrics for individual specialties and teams of
clinicians.

Hospital encounters and episodes of care are recorded in a single table in
which every row corresponds to one episode of care.

```{r}
str(inpatient_episodes)
```

Dates of admissions and episode start/end must be valid:

-   there must be no overlap between admissions or between episodes
-   there must be no gap between episodes in an admission.

```{r}
validate_inpatient_episodes(patients = patients,
                            episodes = inpatient_episodes)
```

Optionally, Ramses can use data on ward movements. These records must be
validated together with episodes of care

```{r}
validate_inpatient_episodes(patients = patients,
                            episodes = inpatient_episodes, 
                            wards = inpatient_wards)
```

The data can now be loaded into the database.

```{r}
load_inpatient_episodes(conn = ramses_db,
                        patients_data = patients,
                        episodes_data = inpatient_episodes,
                        wards_data =  inpatient_wards)
```

## Diagnosis codes (ICD-10)

In order to exploit clinical diagnoses coded by doctors during hospital
admissions, Ramses relies on a range of look up tables which must be
built to suit the precise ICD-10 version used by the data. Ramses uses
three types of look up tables:

-   an ICD-10 reference table containing all ICD-10 codes, their
    full-text description, and chapter headings
-   a categorisation based on the AHRQ Clinical Classification Software
    (CCS) or its Revised version (CCSR)
-   a classification of infections and whether antibiotics are commonly
    indicated to treat them, adapted from @Hashimoto2020

## ICD-10 reference table

This example uses the `Ramses::inpatient_diagnoses` example dataset.
First, we download the ICD-10-CM reference look up table

```{r}
icd10cm <- download_icd10cm()
str(icd10cm)
```

We verify that all ICD-10 codes in the dataset can be mapped to the
reference table. The first validation fails, because some of the
`icd_code` in `inpatient_diagnoses` are missing (all diagnoses that are
not infections). These are removed before validation is attempted again.
In the present example, the dataset is simulated using ICD-10 5th
Edition, rather than ICD-10-CM. The match is therefore not complete on
the second validation attempt. Although the validation produces a
warning, it passes (returns `TRUE`). This means it will not prevent
loading the data into the warehouse.

```{r diagnoses_first_valid_attempt}
validate_inpatient_diagnoses(inpatient_diagnoses, icd10cm)
```

```{r diagnoses_second_valid_attempt}
inpatient_diagnoses <- filter(inpatient_diagnoses, !is.na(icd_code))
validate_inpatient_diagnoses(inpatient_diagnoses, icd10cm)
```

Next, we classify the reference look-up table to other classifications:

-   common infections and indications for antibiotic prescribing (see `Ramses::antibiotic_icd_indications`)
-   Charlson Comorbidity Index weights
-   Clinical Classifications Software (CCS)
-   Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR)

Although this is done automatically when loading diagnoses into the
warehouse, this step can be useful to first check that the ICD-10
reference table is successfully mapped to other classifications.

```{r}
icd_infection_lkup <- icd10cm %>% 
  select(icd_code) %>% 
  map_infections_abx_indications(df = ., icd_column = "icd_code")

comorbidity_lkup <- icd10cm %>% 
  select(icd_code) %>% 
  map_charlson_comorbidities(df = ., icd_column = "icd_code")

ccsr_lkup <- icd10cm %>% 
  select(icd_code) %>% 
  map_ICD10_CCSR(df = ., icd_column = "icd_code")

ccs_lkup <- icd10cm %>% 
  select(icd_code) %>% 
  map_ICD10_CCS(df = ., icd_column = "icd_code")

head(icd_infection_lkup)
```

Data may now be loaded into the database. Diagnoses and their reference
look-up are loaded in one step.

```{r load_diagnoses}
load_inpatient_diagnoses(conn = ramses_db, 
                         diagnoses_data = inpatient_diagnoses, 
                         diagnoses_lookup = icd10cm, 
                         overwrite = TRUE)
```

# Investigation records

## Microbiology culture isolates and susceptibilities

A small sample of records of microbial isolates is provided along with
susceptibility testing results:

```{r show_inpatient_microbiology}
str(Ramses::inpatient_microbiology)
```

Before validating and loading these records into the database, some
transformations will be required to create three separate data frames:

1.  `specimens` contains one row per microbial sample sent to the
    laboratory
2.  `isolates` contains zero, one, or multiple rows for every specimen
    -- as many rows as the number of microorganisms isolated from the
    specimen, whatever the technique (eg mass spectrometry, PCR,
    bacterial culture)
3.  `susceptibility` contains results of susceptibility testing: one row
    per substance tested.

For this, we create a list of data frames named `microbiology_data`, and
commence with cleaning the raw data. We employ the
[AMR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AMR) package to code
microorganism species names (`AMR::as.mo()`) and antimicrobial names
(`AMR::as.ab()`).

```{r}
microbiology_data <- list()

# Start by cleaning the raw data
microbiology_data$raw <- inpatient_microbiology
microbiology_data$raw <- microbiology_data$raw %>% 
  mutate(
    organism_code = AMR::as.mo(if_else(
      organism_display_name == "No growth",
      NA_character_,
      organism_display_name)),
    agent_code = AMR::as.ab(agent_display_name)) %>% 
  mutate(organism_name = AMR::mo_name(organism_code),
         agent_name = AMR::ab_name(agent_code))
```

As for specimen types (eg bood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, etc.),
they must be coded using [SNOMED CT specimen
concepts](https://snowstorm.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=123038009&edition=MAIN/2020-07-31&release=&languages=en).
A complete list of concepts from the SNOMED CT International Edition can
be found in `Ramses::reference_specimen_type`.

Susceptibility testing results in the example dataset are already
interpreted as Resistant/Increased exposure/Susceptible (RSI). Where
needed, minimum inhibitory concentrations and disk diffusion diameters
can be interpreted as RSI using the `as.sir()` function provided by the
AMR package.

If possible, use the most specific concept available (eg
`309176002 | Bronchial brushings sample (specimen) |`) over a more
generic term (eg `258415003 | Biopsy sample (specimen) |`). Specific
concepts can always be reclassified to higher-level concepts using
SNOMED CT inference (in this case, not just
`258415003 | Biopsy sample (specimen) |`, but also
`258603007 | Respiratory sample (specimen) |`). The
[snomedizer](https://snomedizer.web.app/) package can be used to query
SNOMED CT concept parents and descendants.

```{r code_specimen_types}
microbiology_data$raw <- microbiology_data$raw %>% 
  mutate(specimen_type_code = case_when(
    specimen_type_display == "Blood Culture" ~ 
      "446131002", # Blood specimen obtained for blood culture
    specimen_type_display == "Faeces" ~ 
      "119339001", # Stool specimen
    specimen_type_display == "MRSA Screen" ~ 
      "697989009", # Anterior nares swab 
    specimen_type_display == "Urine" ~ 
      "122575003", # Urine specimen
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  )) %>% 
  left_join(transmute(reference_specimen_type,
                      specimen_type_code = conceptId,
                      specimen_type_name = pt_term))

```

The three data frames can now be created.

```{r create_three_micro_dataframes}
microbiology_data$specimens <- microbiology_data$raw %>% 
  transmute(specimen_id,
            patient_id,
            status = "available",
            specimen_datetime,
            specimen_type_code,
            specimen_type_name,
            specimen_type_display) %>% 
  distinct() # Removing duplicates created by multiple isolates and susceptibility testing

microbiology_data$isolates <- microbiology_data$raw %>% 
  transmute(isolate_id,
            specimen_id,
            patient_id,
            organism_code,
            organism_name,
            organism_display_name,
            isolation_datetime) %>% 
  distinct() # Removing duplicates created by susceptibility testing

microbiology_data$susceptibilities <- microbiology_data$raw %>% 
  filter(!is.na(organism_code)) %>%  # Remove no growth
  transmute(isolate_id,
            specimen_id,
            patient_id,
            organism_code,
            organism_name,
            organism_display_name,
            agent_code,
            agent_name,
            agent_display_name,
            rsi_code,
            concept_code = NA_character_) %>% 
  distinct()

```

An optional step is to classify isolates by multidrug resistance
phenotype [@Magiorakos2012]. The AMR package function
`AMR::mdro()` provides classification based on:

-   international guidelines on microorganism intrinsic resistance
-   records of susceptibility testing (RSI).

In this vignette, we adopt intrinsic resistances as defined by EUCAST
guidelines [@EUCASTExpertRules32]. The tidyr package is used to pivot
susceptibility test results into wide format (antimicrobials arranged as
columns).

```{r classify_resistance_isolates}
mdr_classification <- microbiology_data$susceptibilities  %>% 
  select(isolate_id,
         organism_code,
         agent_code,
         rsi_code) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(id_cols = c("isolate_id", "organism_code"),
                     names_from = agent_code,
                     values_from = rsi_code)

mdr_classification$multidrug_resistance <- 
  as.character(AMR::mdro(
    x = mdr_classification,
    guideline = "EUCAST",
    col_mo = "organism_code"))

# Merging back into the isolates dataset
microbiology_data$isolates <- left_join(
  microbiology_data$isolates,
  select(mdr_classification, isolate_id, multidrug_resistance)
)
```

The data may now be validated, and loaded.

```{r}
validate_microbiology(specimens = microbiology_data$specimens,
                      isolates = microbiology_data$isolates,
                      susceptibilities = microbiology_data$susceptibilities)
```

```{r}
load_inpatient_microbiology(
  conn = ramses_db,
  specimens = microbiology_data$specimens,
  isolates = microbiology_data$isolates,
  susceptibilities = microbiology_data$susceptibilities,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

## Clinical investigations

Finally, we import all other observation and test results, from basic
vitals such as respiration rate and blood pressure, to urine antigen
test results. Analysis of such data requires the use of standard test
vocabularies.

The international standard code system for laboratory data is
[LOINC](https://loinc.org/). A sample of important codes may be found in
dataset `Ramses::reference_loinc`. Other observable entity concepts or
evaluation procedure concepts may be imported from SNOMED CT.

```{r show_inpatient_investigations}
data(inpatient_investigations)
str(inpatient_investigations)
```

One particular set of validation constraints apply:

-   units must conform to the [Unified Code for Units of Measure
    (UCUM)](https://ucum.org/). Units are implemented using the `units`
    package in R.
-   an `observation_code` must have one and only one `observation_unit`
    to pass validation. If observation records come in a variety of
    units, they must first be converted to a common unit.

Many important units in medicine are not listed in the UCUM. For
instance:

-   respiration rate (breaths/min)
-   heart rate (beats/min)
-   alkaline phosphatase in serum (international unit per liter notated
    U/L)

By default, these three custom units are passed to the `custom_units`
argument of `validate_investigations()`. Any other custom unit in the
dataset must be handled with this argument.

```{r validate_invest}
validate_investigations(inpatient_investigations, 
                        custom_units = c("breaths", "beats", "U"))
```

Data may now be loaded into the database.

```{r load_invest}
load_inpatient_investigations(
  conn = ramses_db,
  investigations_data = inpatient_investigations, 
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

# Final steps

There is one final step to create ancillary tables:

```{r final_tables}
# Create bridge tables
bridge_tables(conn = ramses_db, overwrite = TRUE)

# Create reference AWaRe table (see ?reference_aware)
dplyr::copy_to(dest = ramses_db,
               df = filter(reference_aware, version == "England" & year == "2019"),
               name = "reference_aware",
               temporary = FALSE,
               overwrite = TRUE)
```

The database is now ready.

The main vignette (getting started) demonstrates how to use it.

# Once you are done

Always remember close database connections when you are finished.

```{r}
DBI::dbDisconnect(ramses_db, shutdown = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
file.remove("ramses-db.duckdb")
```
